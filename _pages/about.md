I do research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) in [GIK Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/garudailmukomputer/about) with [Derry Wijaya, Ph.D](https://derrywijaya.github.io/web/) and [Dr. Eng. Ayu Purwarianti, S.T, M.T.](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/ayu-purwarianti). My research interests are low-resource languages and Multilingual NLP. Currently, I'm working Indonesian Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and exploring methods to train machine translation models that learn from beyond parallel sentences.

I received my B. Sc. in Informatics/CS (Hons) from [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://stei.itb.ac.id/) and was advised by [Dr. Eng. Ayu Purwarianti, S.T, M.T.](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/ayu-purwarianti). My [undergraduate thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pH1yDeesF4Aw-kfJ91-2Z_Xyb_7N9mp7/view?usp=sharing) is about using LLM-generated synthetic data to improve machine translation between Indonesian and Javanese, a low resource language in Indonesia whose I'm a native speaker of.
